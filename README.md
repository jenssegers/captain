## Usage

Captain searches for docker-compose projects in your `$HOME` folder and allows you to start and stop those projects by matching the project's directory name.

### Starting a project

If I have a folder called `my-secret-project` that contains a `docker-compose.yml` file, I can start that project using:

```
captain start my-secret-project
```

Captain will also do partial matching of the project name, so that you can also use:

```
captain start secret
```

Captain is smart, and does fuzzy matching:

```
captain start scrt
```

### Stopping a project

Stopping a project works similarly:

```
captain stop secret
```

### Restarting a project

Restart a project using:

```
captain restart my-secret-project
```

### Viewing project logs

View logs of a project using:

```
captain logs my-secret-project
```

### Listing projects

You can see all managable projects using:

```
captain list
```

### Stopping all containers

To quickly stop all running docker containers, use:

```
captain abandon
```

### Executing command in a service

Executing command in a running service container

```
captain exec <project> <service> <command>
captain exec my-secret-project web bash
```

Executing command as a new service container

```
captain run <project> <service> <command>
captain run my-secret-project cli bash
```

## Tweak the running

You can tweak some behaviour through some environmental variables:

* CAPTAIN_ROOT: the starting directory from where the docker-compose are searched (default: home dir of the user)
* CAPTAIN_DEPTH: the number of subdirectory where to search the docker-compose.yml files (default: 5)
